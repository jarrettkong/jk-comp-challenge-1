# Dog Party
This goal of this project is to recreate this card-based UI in order to practice alignment and `flex-box`.

## Description
We were given control over the copy, colors, and images. I chose to create a UI that would display game information a format similar to Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/).

The project is created with only HTML and CSS, and responds properly to resizing the window, as well as mobile viewports down to 320px width.

Below is the original comp to replicate:
